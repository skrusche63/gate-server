===========

[GATE](http://http://gate.ac.uk/) text mining is a mature platform for almost any kind of text analysis use case.

In order to seamlessly integrate GATE with other applications, platforms or frameworks, we have embedded GATE into 
a socket server. One of the intended use cases is to use GATE with a distributed real-time computation system such 
as **Storm**.
